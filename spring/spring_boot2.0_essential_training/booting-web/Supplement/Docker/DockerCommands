# docker build -t myimage .
# docker run -it --rm my_image
# docker run -it --rm my_image arg2 arg3 arg4 ; this will override the CMD at the last line of the Dockerfile
# -i interactive
# -t tty
# --rm The --rm flag is there to tell the Docker Daemon to clean up the container and remove the file system after the container exits.

# Override the Docker Entrypoint
docker run -entrypoint <command and arguments>

# Keep Docker Container Running (if not entrypoint in the Dockerfile)
docker run -t -d my_image     # use -t tty and -d detached in background parameters to keep docker container running even after exit

# Now lets try to enter into the Docker Container terminal
docker exec -it 0ab99d8ab11c /bin/bash

# Dockerfile having entrypoint exit after executing the ENTYPOINT command and argument.
# But if you want the docker remain alive even after the entry point, override the entrypoint before the docker_image_name
# Never place the entrypoint after the docker image name
docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash my_image
